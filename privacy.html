  <h1>Privacy Policy for iBudgetPro</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated: January&nbsp;5,&nbsp;2026</strong></p>

  <p>iBudgetPro respects your privacy.</p>

  <p>
    iBudgetPro stores all budget and financial information locally on the user’s device.
    The app allows users to optionally sync or export their data using services chosen and
    controlled by the user, such as Apple&nbsp;iCloud, Dropbox, or email.
  </p>

  <p>
    iBudgetPro does not operate its own backend servers.
    No data is collected, stored, or accessed by the developer.
    Data synchronization via iCloud occurs through the user’s personal Apple&nbsp;ID.
    Dropbox integration uses the user’s own Dropbox account and authorization.
    Email exports are initiated by the user and sent to recipients of their choosing.
  </p>

  <p>
    The app does not use analytics, advertising, or tracking technologies.
    No data is sold or shared with third parties for marketing or tracking purposes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Users are responsible for managing and backing up their data using their device’s built-in
    backup features.
  </p>
